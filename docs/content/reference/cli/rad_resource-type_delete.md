## rad resource-type delete

Delete resource provider

### Synopsis

Delete resource provider
		
Resource types are the entities that implement resource types such as 'Applications.Core/containers'. Each resource type can define multiple API versions, and each API version defines a schema that resource instances conform to. Resource providers can be created and deleted by users.

Deleting a resource type will delete all resources of the specifed resource type. For example, deleting 'Applications.Core/containers' will delete all containers.

```
rad resource-type delete [resource type] [flags]
